NAME
     droetker -- static site generator

SYNOPSIS
     droetker [-dfh] <command>

DESCRIPTION
     droetker is a static website generator written in sh(1).  It provides a
     basic templating system through cpp(1).

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported by droetker:

     -d      Display additional information.

     -f      Force stuff.

     -h      Display a small help text, which might not help you at all as it
             refers you to the -help command.  You are better off by using
             that one.

COMMANDS
     The following commands are supported by droetker:

     help    Display usage information and a list of commands.

     new site_name
             Create a new website scaffold in PWD/site_name.

     build   Build the site in OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.  If OUTPUT_DIRECTORY is not
             set, the site is built in PWD/_site.

             If droetker can not find the configuration file PWD/_config.sh,
             it does not attempt to build the site.

             The output directory will not be deleted if it already exists.

     serve   Serves your site locally.  This command requires Ruby to run.

FRONT MATTER
     droetker allows per-page configuration using the front matter.  The front
     matter consists of key/value pairs, which look like this:

           ---
           PAGE_LAYOUT=default.html
           PAGE_PREPROCESSOR=redcarpet
           ---

     Note the triple dashes at the begin and end of the key/value pairs.
     These are required, otherwise droetker will not attempt to process the
     file with cpp(1).

     Every value is accessible anywhere in the page with $KEY.

     There are some special keys that droetker makes use of.  These are:

     PAGE_LAYOUT
             The to be used layout.  The layouts are usually located in the
             _layouts subdirectory.

     PAGE_PREPROCESSOR
             Preprocess the page using the given preprocessor.  droetker will
             run the preprocessor like this:

                   echo content | $PAGE_PREPROCESSOR

     PAGE_PREPROCESSOR_ARGS
             Run the preprocessor with the given arguments.  It overrides
             SITE_PREPROCESSOR_ARGS.

FILES
     _config.sh    The configuration file for a site.  If this file is not in
                   PWD, droetker refuses to build the site.

BUGS
     Yes.
