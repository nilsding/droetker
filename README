DESCRIPTION
     droetker is a static website generator written in sh(1).  It provides a
     basic templating system through cpp(1).

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported by droetker:

     -d      Display additional information.

     -f      Force stuff.

     -h      Display a small help text, which might not help you at all as it
             refers you to the -help command.  You are better off by using
             that one.

COMMANDS
     The following commands are supported by droetker:

     new site_name
             Create a new website scaffold in PWD/site_name.

     build   Build the site in OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.  If OUTPUT_DIRECTORY is not
             set, the site is built in PWD/_site.

             If droetker can not find the configuration file PWD/_config.sh,
             it does not attempt to build the site.

             The output directory will not be deleted if it already exists.

     serve   Serves your site locally.  This command requires Ruby to run.

FILES
     _config.sh    The configuration file for a site.  If this file is not in
                   PWD, droetker refuses to build the site.

BUGS
     Yes.
